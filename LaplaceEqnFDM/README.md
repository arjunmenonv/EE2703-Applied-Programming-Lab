# Solving Laplace's Equation Numerically using Finite Difference Method

The potential distribution and current density profile on a metallic plate grounded at one edge with a central circular region maintained at 1V is computed by numerically solving Laplace's equation (First order approximation of the Taylor series). More details on the implementation and the districutions of potential and current denisites may be found [here](https://github.com/arjunmenonv/EE2703-Applied-Programming-Lab/blob/master/LaplaceEqnFDM/ResistorProblem.pdf).
