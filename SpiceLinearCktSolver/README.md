# Spice Based Linear Circuit Solver

In this code, a netlist text file is read and the corresponding circuit model is generated. Further for circuits containing only linear components with DC or single-frequency AC excitation, the circuit is solved and the nodal voltages and currents through voltage sources are returned.

Syntax of the netlist is the same as that of any SPICE netlist file. Check it out [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee133/handouts/general/spice_ref.pdf)
